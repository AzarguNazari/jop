TODOs
------

o) MethodCacheAnalysis
- findRemovedMethods(): Current implementation not correct, needs fixing
- make cache cost estimation for ALL_FIT_REGIONS approximation more precise when region changes
- handle case when region increases

o) EjipCmp benchmark does not work
- We need to remove Tcp.run() from callee set of Runnable.run(), else it will try to invoke
  TcpHandler.*, which has no implementations since the benchmark does not use Tcp implementation classes
