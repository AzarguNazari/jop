WCET Regression Test
--------------------
Make sure WCET does not change after refactoring, computing the WCET
of the benchmarks specified in benchmarks.txt

Use
  ./wcet_test set <name>
to record a new set of WCET times
and
  ./wcet_test check <name>
to check against a set of WCET times.

All tests have to follow the scheme used in test/wcet/StartLift.java,
with a global variable MEASURE set to true for measurements.
